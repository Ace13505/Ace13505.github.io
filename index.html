        I started by pressing the windows button on my keybaord which opened up the search engine where I searched 
        for WSL<br>

        After opening it I went to my github and made a repository named username.github.io and clicked on 
        code button which gave me a https option to clone it and I copied the link <br>

        I then typed in git clone cloneLink to clone the repository in my pc then ls to see the list of items
        and cd to open the file <br>

        I made a html file with hello world typed in using echo "Hello World" > index.html  <br>

        Afterwards I decided to add all the changes using git add. and commit them git commit -m '' and pushed them to github 
        using git push origin main <br>

        Now I needed to use github pages to help me make a website  which can be done by going to github settings 
        and pages inside it where you have to select a branch location main/root after which openign username.github.io would
        opem the webpage <br>

        Then I decided to open this file in VS code for which I need to install the extention WSL which I did
        then clicking on file in VS code allowed to open the folder from WSL that allowed me to code in VSCode and make
        changes which I then need to add commit and push in wsl to push them to github <br>
